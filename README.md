# DeltaMind

A small implementation of neural networks, written in C++. Originally written in an afternoon.

Made in collaboration with [lushobarlett](https://github.com/lushobarlett).

## Build

Run:

```shell
cd build
make
```

This will produce the file `build/libdeltamind.o`, a static library.

```shell
cd example
make
```

This will build the library, as well as a simple usage example.
